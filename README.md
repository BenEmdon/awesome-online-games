| Game | Players |Pricing | Description |
|------|-----------|--------|-------------|
|[**Codenames**](https://codenames.game/) | 2+/4+ |  Free | Two rival spymasters know the secret identities of 25 agents. Their teammates know the agents only by their codenames. To win the game, your team will need to contact all of your agents in the field before the other team finds their own agents. And watch out for the assassin – meet him in the field and your team is done! |
|[**Coup – BGA**](https://boardgamearena.com/gamepanel?game=coupcitystate)| 2-8 | [BGA Premium](https://boardgamearena.com/premium) | Coup is a bluffing and deduction card game where you are the head of a family in a corrupt Italian city-state. Your goal is to be the last player with influence. For this, you need to manipulate, backstab, bluff and bribe to destroy the power of the other families. |
|[**Drawful 2**](https://www.jackboxgames.com/drawful-two/)| 3-8 | [Price](https://www.jackboxgames.com/drawful-two/) | In Drawful, each player receives a weird and unique prompt that they must try to draw on their mobile device (without the aid of an eraser). After each “artist” presents their work, everyone else anonymously submits a title that could fit this bizarre drawing. Your goal is to somehow find the correct prompt while fooling other players into selecting your decoy answer. Bonus points are awarded to those who submitted decoys that are especially clever or dumb… it’s usually the dumb ones. |
|[**Quiplash**](https://www.jackboxgames.com/quiplash/)| 3-8 | [Price](https://www.jackboxgames.com/quiplash/)| There are no rules or correct answers. You just say whatever you want! Your answer will be pitted against another player’s answer in a head-to-head battle. Other players – and even an audience of up to 10,000 people – then vote on their favorite answer. It’s that simple. |
|[**Saboteur – BGA**](https://boardgamearena.com/gamepanel?game=saboteur)| 2-12 | Free | A classic game of treasure and trickery. Hide your identity and don’t trust anyone... It’s Miners vs. Saboteurs in this race for the gold. As you lay your cards and build a path, your friends are lurking ready to destroy your plans. Work with the other Miners to find all the gold nuggets and win the game. But watch out for the Saboteurs who will change your path or destroy your supplies. |
|[**skribbl.io**](https://skribbl.io)| 3-12| Free | skribbl.io is a free multiplayer drawing and guessing game. One game consists of a few rounds in which every round someone has to draw their chosen word and others have to guess it to gain points! The person with the most points at the end of game will then be crowned as the winner! |
|[**SOLO – BGA**](https://boardgamearena.com/gamepanel?game=solo)| 2-10 | Free | Each player gets eight cards. The player who is the first one to put all his cards on the table is the winner. But Beware! There are peculiar action cards which can turn everything upside down. SOLO is a new variant of Mau-Mau with special action cards, that will guarantee a lot of fun.|
|[**Spyfall**](https://www.spyfall.app)| 4-10 | Free | All players, except one, get cards with the same location: a casino, a traveling circus, a pirate ship or even a space station. One of the players gets the “Spy” card instead of a location. Then, players start asking each other free questions, trying to guess — who is the spy, by listening to answers. |
